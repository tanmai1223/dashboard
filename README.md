# 📊 Multi-Feature Dashboard App (React)

An interactive multi-page **Dashboard Web App** built using **React.js**. This project simulates a real-world user journey across login, onboarding, weather dashboard, utility tools (notes + stopwatch), and personalized film recommendations — all powered by **React components** and **API integrations**.

Built as part of my Full Stack Development journey at **Cuvette**.
